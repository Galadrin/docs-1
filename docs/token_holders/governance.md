# Governance

:::tip
**Note:** Working on a governance proposal? Make sure to look at the [best practices](./governance/best_practices.md).
:::

KYVE has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing
text proposals, changing [chain parameters](./governance/param_change.md), and spending [funds from the community pool](./governance/community_pool.md).

## On- and off-chain Governance Structure

### Communication Methods

Governance practices and decisions are communicated through different types of documents and design artifacts:

- On-chain governance [proposals](https://app.kyve.network/#/governance)
- Architecture Decision records
- Technical standards / specifications

### Decision-making and Discussion Venues

Venues involve community members to different degrees and individuals often perform multiple roles in the Cosmos ecosystem (validators, users, developers and core-members of KYVE Team). Because technical direction setting and development is almost always happening in the open, involvement from members in the extended community occurs organically.
