# Networks

Currently, KYVE has two active networks. Both are testnets, meaning the native currency $KYVE has no value and the data is not safe to use. In the future, KYVE will have it's third network: Mainnet.

## Korellia

## Kaon

Kaon is the newest network which is KYVE's official testnet. It should mirror the mainnet and before upgrades are applied on mainnet they should first be successfully applied in this testnet.

## Mainnet

Coming soon
