# Configuration

## Directory structure

By default, the folder at `~/.kyve` is where your configuration and data are saved.

```
.                                    # ~/.kyve
  ├── data/                          # Contains the application state and history.
  └── config/
      ├── app.toml                   # Application-related configuration file.
      ├── client.toml                # Client-related configuration file.
      ├── config.toml                # Tendermint-related configuration file.
      ├── genesis.json               # The genesis file.
      ├── node_key.json              # Private key to use for node authentication in the p2p protocol.
      └── priv_validator_key.json    # Private key to use as a validator in the consensus protocol.
```

The home directory of `kyved` can be specified and updated by using the global flag `--home <directory>`

## Main config files

The Cosmos SDK automatically generates two configuration files inside `~/.kyve/config`:

- `config.toml`: used to configure Tendermint, learn more on [Tendermint's documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/main/tendermint-core/configuration.html)
- `app.toml`: generated by the Cosmos SDK, and used to configure your app, such as state pruning strategies, telemetry, gRPC and REST servers configuration, state sync, JSON-RPC, etc.
- `client.toml`: generated by the Cosmos SDK, and used to configure your client, such as keyring backend, chain id or broadcast mode

## Peer configuration

In `~/.kyve/config/config.toml` you can set your peers. We would recommend setting those peers in the config file directly. Available persistent peers can be found below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="korellia" label="Korellia">
    Default persistent peers:
    <br/><br/>

```bash
persistent_peers = "02dd2c26948ea758a25d3dbc91744f8897681652@3.73.27.185:26656"
```

  Other persistent peers can be found <a href="https://rpc.korellia.kyve.network/net_info">here</a>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kaon" label="Kaon">
    TODO
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">
    Coming Soon
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
**Note:** You can share your peer with the `tendermint show-node-id` command.

```
./kyved tendermint show-node-id

## Disk Usage Optimization

The size of the blockchain database typically increases with time, depending on factors such as block speed and transaction volume.

Fortunately, there are several configurations that can significantly reduce the disk space required. However, some of these changes may only take full effect when you configure and sync from the beginning with the new settings.

### Pruning

By default the last 362880 states are kept and at a 10 block interval the state gets pruned. By specifying "nothing" the node
will not delete anything and all the history will be stored. This setting is required for "archival nodes". By specifying "everything" the 2 latest states will be kept, pruning at 10 block intervals.

```bash
pruning = "default | nothing | everything"
```

Of course custom pruning strategies can be applied. More information can be found in the comments of `app.toml`

### State-sync snapshots

State sync snapshots allow other nodes to rapidly join the network without replaying historical blocks, instead downloading and applying a snapshot of the application state at a given height. This is disabled by default and can be specified in `app.toml`

```bash
snapshot-interval = 0
```

snapshot-interval specifies the block interval at which local state sync snapshots are taken (0 to disable).

### Logging

The default logging level is set to "info" which generates a large number of logs. This level of logging can be helpful at the beginning to ensure that the node is syncing properly. However, once you have confirmed that syncing is progressing smoothly, you can reduce the log level to "warn" or "error". On `config.toml` set the following:

```bash
log_level = "warn"
```
