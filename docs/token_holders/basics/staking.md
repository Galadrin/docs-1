# Staking

## What is staking, and why is it important?

A storage pool requires protocol nodes that upload and validate data. To ensure that nodes upload correct data
and validate honestly, the protocol nodes have to stake $KYVE. When protocol nodes stake $KYVE in a pool, they are allowed to operate in that specific pool. In case of nodes misbehaving (e.g., uploading and submitting invalid data or validating incorrectly), the node would get [slashed](/basics/slashing.md). In return for the risk of being slashed and the work of uploading and validating data, nodes are rewarded with $KYVE based on their staking amount.

## Who would stake in a pool?

Users who want to participate in a pool and want to earn staking rewards.

## How can I stake in a pool?

You can stake in a pool through the KYVE [app](https://app.kyve.network). Select a pool you are interested in and click on the staking tab to become a validator. You can withdraw your stake with an unbonding time.

::: warning
**IMPORTANT**: When you stake your $KYVE, you are in danger of getting slashed for being offline. Ensure that you are running a protocol node with the correct runtime in the right pool **before** you stake.
